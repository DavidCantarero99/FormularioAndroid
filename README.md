It offers a declarative approach to UI development, simplifying the process of creating intuitive and dynamic user interfaces. With Jetpack Compose, you can easily implement features like bottom tab navigation, enabling users to [navigate](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/navigation) between different sections of your app with ease. Combining the power of Jetpack Compose's declarative UI paradigm and the Navigation component, you can create seamless and engaging navigation experiences for your users.

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire,
and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

**Note**: Please note that while this project focuses primarily on the use of ``Jetpack Compose``, it does not currently incorporate the use of ``foreground services`` for playing music in the background. This is an area where contributions would be particularly valuable, as foreground services are recommended for such functionality in Android development.

If you would like to contribute, please follow these steps:

1. Open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
2. Fork the Project
3. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some amazing feature'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
6. Open a pull request

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
